Extended Parallel Corpus for Amharic-English Machine Translation: A Detailed Review
This paper, titled "Extended Parallel Corpus for Amharic-English Machine Translation" by Andargachew Mekonnen Gezmu et al., introduces a valuable resource for the field of machine translation: a new and extended parallel corpus for the Amharic-English language pair.

Key Contributions:

Corpus Creation: The authors compiled a new Amharic-English parallel corpus by extending an existing one and collecting additional data from various sources like news articles, magazines, and the Bible. They addressed challenges like normalization, spelling correction, and sentence segmentation.
Baseline Systems: The paper establishes baseline performance for Amharic-English machine translation using both statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (NMT) approaches.
Performance Evaluation: The authors evaluated the performance of the SMT and NMT models using BLEU, BEER, and CharacTER metrics. Their findings show:
NMT models outperform SMT models by a significant margin (6-7 BLEU points).
Subword-based NMT models perform better than word-based models (3-4 BLEU points).
Utilizing a large monolingual corpus for language modeling (SMT) and back-translation (NMT) can further improve performance.
Strengths:

Addresses resource scarcity: This work contributes to addressing the scarcity of parallel corpora for low-resource languages like Amharic, making it a valuable resource for researchers working in this area.
Open access corpus: The authors made the corpus freely available, promoting further research and development in Amharic machine translation.
Comprehensive evaluation: The paper employs multiple evaluation metrics (BLEU, BEER, CharacTER) to provide a well-rounded assessment of the models' performance.
Future Work:

Corpus expansion: The authors suggest increasing the corpus size by extracting text from scanned documents, further enriching the resource.
Word segmentation exploration: They plan to experiment with different word segmentation methods for subword-based NMT, potentially leading to further improvements.
Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of Amharic-English machine translation. The creation of the extended corpus, establishment of baseline systems, and performance evaluation provide a foundation for future research and development in this area.
