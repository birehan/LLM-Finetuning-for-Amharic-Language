"14  and i was making greater progress in juʹda·ism than many of my own age in my nation, as i was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.+"
"15  but when god, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his undeserved kindness,+ thought good"
"16  to reveal his son through me so that i might declare the good news about him to the nations,+ i did not immediately consult with any human;*"
"17  nor did i go up to jerusalem to those who were apostles before i was, but i went to arabia, and then i returned to damascus.+ "
"18  then three years later i went up to jerusalem+ to visit ceʹphas,*+ and i stayed with him for 15 days."
"19  but i did not see any of the other apostles, only james+ the brother of the lord."
"20  now regarding the things i am writing you, i assure you before god that i am not lying. "
21  after that i went into the regions of syria and ci·liʹcia.+
22  but i was personally unknown to the congregations of ju·deʹa that were in union with christ.
23  they only used to hear: “the man who formerly persecuted us+ is now declaring the good news about the faith that he formerly devastated.”+
24  so they began glorifying god because of me.
"2  then after 14 years i again went up to jerusalem with barʹna·bas,+ also taking titus along with me.+"
"2  i went up as a result of a revelation, and i presented to them the good news that i am preaching among the nations. this was done privately, however, before the men who were highly regarded, to make sure that i was not running or had not run in vain."
"3  nevertheless, not even titus,+ who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised,+ although he was a greek."
"4  but that matter came up because of the false brothers brought in quietly,+ who slipped in to spy on the freedom+ we enjoy in union with christ jesus, so that they might completely enslave us;+"
"5  we did not yield in submission to them,+ no, not for a moment,* so that the truth of the good news might continue with you. "
"6  but regarding those who seemed to be important+—whatever they were makes no difference to me, for god does not go by a man’s outward appearance—those highly regarded men imparted nothing new to me."
"7  on the contrary, when they saw that i had been entrusted with the good news for those who are uncircumcised,+ just as peter had been for those who are circumcised—"
8  for the one who empowered peter for an apostleship to those who are circumcised also empowered me for those who are of the nations+—
"9  and when they recognized the undeserved kindness that was given me,+ james+ and ceʹphas* and john, the ones who seemed to be pillars, gave barʹna·bas and me+ the right hand of fellowship,* so that we should go to the nations but they to those who are circumcised."
"10  they asked only that we keep the poor in mind, and this i have also earnestly endeavored to do.+ "
"11  however, when ceʹphas*+ came to antioch,+ i resisted* him face-to-face, because he was clearly in the wrong.*"
"12  for before certain men from james+ arrived, he used to eat with people of the nations;+ but when they arrived, he stopped doing this and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcised class.+"
"13  the rest of the jews also joined him in putting on this pretense,* so that even barʹna·bas was led along with them in their pretense.*"
"14  but when i saw that they were not walking in step with the truth of the good news,+ i said to ceʹphas* before them all: “if you, though you are a jew, live as the nations do and not as jews do, how can you compel people of the nations to live according to jewish practice?”+ "
"15  we who are jews by birth, and not sinners from the nations,"
"16  recognize that a man is declared righteous, not by works of law, but only through faith+ in jesus christ.+ so we have put our faith in christ jesus, so that we may be declared righteous by faith in christ and not by works of law, for no one* will be declared righteous by works of law.+"
"17  now if we have also been found sinners while seeking to be declared righteous by means of christ, is christ then sin’s minister? certainly not!"
"18  if the very things that i once tore down i build up again, i demonstrate that i am a transgressor."
"19  for through law i died toward law,+ so that i might become alive toward god."
"20  i am nailed to the stake along with christ.+ it is no longer i who live,+ but it is christ who is living in union with me. indeed, the life that i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god,+ who loved me and handed himself over for me.+"
"21  i do not reject* the undeserved kindness of god,+ for if righteousness is through law, christ actually died for nothing.+"
"4  now i say that as long as the heir is a young child, he is no different from a slave, although he is the lord of all things,"
2  but he is under supervisors and stewards until the day set ahead of time by his father.
"3  likewise, we too, when we were children, were enslaved by the elementary things of the world.+"
"4  but when the full limit of the time arrived, god sent his son, who was born of a woman+ and who was under law,+"
"5  that he might release by purchase those under law,+ so that we might receive the adoption as sons.+ "
"6  now because you are sons, god has sent the spirit+ of his son into our hearts,+ and it cries out: “abba,* father!”+"
"7  so you are no longer a slave but a son; and if a son, then you are also an heir through god.+ "
"8  nevertheless, when you did not know god, you were enslaved to those who are not really gods."
"9  but now that you have come to know god or, rather, have come to be known by god, how is it that you are turning back again to the weak+ and beggarly elementary things and want to slave for them over again?+"
10  you are scrupulously observing days and months+ and seasons and years.
"11  i fear for you, that somehow i have wasted my efforts on you. "
"12  brothers, i beg you, become as i am, because i also used to be as you are.+ you did me no wrong."
13  but you know that it was because of a physical illness that i had my first opportunity to declare the good news to you.
"14  and though my physical condition was a trial for you, you did not treat me with contempt or disgust;* but you received me like an angel of god, like christ jesus."
"15  where is that happiness you had? for i bear you witness that, if it had been possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.+"
"16  so, then, have i become your enemy because i tell you the truth?"
"17  they are zealous to win you over, but not for a good purpose; they want to alienate you from me, so that you may be eager to follow them."
"18  however, it is always fine for someone to seek zealously after you for a good purpose and not just when i am present with you,"
"19  my little children,+ for whom i am again experiencing birth pains until christ is formed* in you."
"20  i wish i could be present with you just now and speak in a different way, because i am perplexed over you. "
"21  tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not hear the law?"
"22  for example, it is written that abraham had two sons, one by the servant girl+ and one by the free woman;+"
23  but the one by the servant girl was actually born through natural descent*+ and the other by the free woman through a promise.+
"24  these things may be taken as a symbolic drama; for these women mean two covenants, the one from mount siʹnai,+ which bears children for slavery and which is haʹgar."
"25  now haʹgar means siʹnai,+ a mountain in arabia, and she corresponds with the jerusalem today, for she is in slavery with her children."
"26  but the jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. "
"27  for it is written: “be glad, you barren woman who does not give birth; break into joyful shouting, you woman who does not have birth pains; for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of her who has the husband.”+"
"28  now you, brothers, are children of the promise the same as isaac was.+"
"29  but just as then the one born through natural descent* began persecuting the one born through spirit,+ so also now.+"
"30  nevertheless, what does the scripture say? “drive out the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl will by no means be an heir with the son of the free woman.”+"
"31  so, brothers, we are children, not of a servant girl, but of the free woman."
"6  brothers, even if a man takes a false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness.+ but keep an eye on yourself,+ for fear you too may be tempted.+"
"2  go on carrying the burdens of one another,+ and in this way you will fulfill the law of the christ.+"
"3  for if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing,+ he is deceiving himself."
"4  but let each one examine his own actions,+ and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.+"
5  for each one will carry his own load.*+ 
"6  moreover, let anyone who is being taught* the word share in all good things with the one who gives such teaching.*+ "
"7  do not be misled: god is not one to be mocked. for whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap;+"
"8  because the one sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh, but the one sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.+"
"9  so let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.*+"
"10  so, then, as long as we have the opportunity,* let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith. "
11  see with what large letters i have written you with my own hand. 
"12  all those who want to make a good impression in the flesh* are the ones who try to compel you to get circumcised, doing so only to avoid being persecuted for the torture stake* of the christ."
"13  for even those who are getting circumcised do not keep the law themselves,+ but they want you to be circumcised so that they may have cause for boasting about your flesh."
"14  but may i never boast, except in the torture stake* of our lord jesus christ,+ through whom the world has been put to death* with regard to me and i with regard to the world."
"15  for neither is circumcision anything nor is uncircumcision,+ but a new creation is.+"
"16  as for all those who walk orderly by this rule of conduct, peace and mercy be upon them, yes, upon the israel of god.+ "
"17  from now on let no one make trouble for me, for i am bearing on my body the brand marks of a slave of jesus.+ "
"18  the undeserved kindness of our lord jesus christ be with the spirit you show, brothers. amen."
"5  for such freedom christ set us free. therefore, stand firm,+ and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.+ "
"2  see! i, paul, am telling you that if you become circumcised, christ will be of no benefit to you.+"
3  again i bear witness to every man who gets circumcised that he is under obligation to keep the whole law.+
"4  you are separated from christ, you who are trying to be declared righteous by means of law;+ you have fallen away from his undeserved kindness."
"5  for our part, we are by spirit eagerly waiting for the hoped-for righteousness resulting from faith."
"6  for in union with christ jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any value,+ but faith operating through love is. "
7  you were running well.+ who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth?
8  this sort of persuasion does not come from the one calling you.
9  a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough.+
"10  i am confident that you who are in union with the lord+ will not come to think otherwise; but the one who is causing you trouble,+ whoever he may be, will receive the judgment he deserves."
"11  as for me, brothers, if i am still preaching circumcision, why am i still being persecuted? in that case the stumbling block of the torture stake*+ has been eliminated."
12  i wish the men who are trying to unsettle you would emasculate themselves.* 
"13  you were called to freedom, brothers; only do not use this freedom as an opportunity to pursue fleshly desires,+ but through love slave for one another.+"
"14  for the entire law has been fulfilled* in one commandment, namely: “you must love your neighbor as yourself.”+"
"15  if, though, you keep on biting and devouring one another,+ look out that you do not get annihilated by one another.+ "
"16  but i say, keep walking by spirit+ and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all.+"
"17  for the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do the very things you want to do.+"
"18  furthermore, if you are being led by spirit, you are not under law. "
"19  now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, and they are sexual immorality,*+ uncleanness, brazen conduct,*+"
"20  idolatry, spiritism,*+ hostility, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects,"
"21  envy, drunkenness,+ wild parties,* and things like these.+ i am forewarning you about these things, the same way i already warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit god’s kingdom.+ "
"22  on the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,* kindness, goodness,+ faith,"
"23  mildness, self-control.+ against such things there is no law."
"24  moreover, those who belong to christ jesus have nailed to the stake the flesh together with its passions and desires.+ "
"25  if we are living by spirit, let us also go on walking orderly by spirit.+"
"26  let us not become egotistical,+ stirring up competition with one another,+ envying one another."
"3  for this reason i, paul, the prisoner+ of christ jesus in behalf of you, the people of the nations—"
"2  if, really, you have heard about the stewardship+ of god’s undeserved kindness that was given to me for your sakes,"
"3  that by way of a revelation the sacred secret was made known to me, just as i wrote previously in brief."
"4  so when you read this, you can realize my comprehension of the sacred secret+ of the christ."
"5  in other generations this secret was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by spirit,+"
"6  namely, that people of the nations should, in union with christ jesus and through the good news, be joint heirs and fellow members of the body+ and partakers with us of the promise."
7  i became a minister of this according to the free gift of god’s undeserved kindness that was given me through the operation of his power.+ 
"8  to me, a man less than the least of all holy ones,+ this undeserved kindness was given,+ so that i should declare to the nations the good news about the unfathomable riches of the christ"
"9  and should make everyone see the administration of the sacred secret+ that has been hidden through the ages in god, who created all things."
"10  this was so that now, through the congregation,+ there might be made known to the governments and the authorities in the heavenly places the greatly diversified wisdom of god.+"
"11  this is according to the eternal purpose that he formed in connection with the christ,+ jesus our lord,"
12  by means of whom we have this freeness of speech and free access+ with confidence through our faith in him.
"13  so i ask you not to give up on account of my tribulations in your behalf, for these mean glory for you.+ "
"14  for this reason i bend my knees to the father,"
15  to whom every family in heaven and on earth owes its name.
"16  i pray that he may grant you through the abundance of his glory to be made mighty in the man you are inside,+ with power through his spirit,"
"17  and that through your faith you may have the christ dwell in your hearts with love.+ may you be rooted+ and established on the foundation,+"
"18  in order that with all the holy ones you may be thoroughly able to comprehend fully what is the breadth and length and height and depth,"
"19  and to know the love of the christ,+ which surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness that god gives. "
"20  now to the one who can, according to his power that is operating in us,+ do more than superabundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive,+"
21  to him be the glory by means of the congregation and by means of christ jesus to all generations forever and ever. amen.
"1  paul, an apostle of christ jesus through god’s will, to the holy ones who are in ephʹe·sus+ and are faithful in union with christ jesus: "
"3  praised be the god and father of our lord jesus christ, for he has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in union with christ,+"
"4  as he chose us to be in union with him* before the founding of the world, that we should be holy and unblemished+ before him in love."
"5  for he foreordained us+ to be adopted as his own sons+ through jesus christ, according to his good pleasure and will,+"
6  in praise of his glorious undeserved kindness+ that he kindly bestowed on us by means of his beloved one.+
"7  by means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one,+ yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses,+ according to the riches of his undeserved kindness. "
8  this undeserved kindness he caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding*
9  by making known to us the sacred secret+ of his will. it is according to his good pleasure that he himself purposed
"10  for an administration* at the full limit of the appointed times, to gather all things together in the christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth.+ yes, in him"
"11  with whom we are in union and were assigned as heirs,+ having been foreordained according to the purpose of the one who accomplishes all things as he decides according to his will,"
12  so that we who have been first to hope in the christ should serve for the praise of his glory.
"13  but you also hoped in him after you heard the word of truth, the good news about your salvation. after you believed, you were sealed+ by means of him with the promised holy spirit,"
"14  which is a token in advance* of our inheritance,+ for the purpose of releasing god’s own possession+ by a ransom,+ to his glorious praise. "
"15  that is why i also, since i have heard of the faith that you have in the lord jesus and the love that you demonstrate toward all the holy ones,"
"16  never stop giving thanks for you. i continue mentioning you in my prayers,"
"17  that the god of our lord jesus christ, the father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the accurate knowledge of him.+"
"18  he has enlightened the eyes of your heart, so that you may know to what hope he called you, what glorious riches he holds as an inheritance for the holy ones,+"
"19  and how surpassing the greatness of his power is toward us believers.+ it is according to the operation of the mightiness of his strength,"
"20  which he exercised toward christ when he raised him up from the dead and seated him at his right hand+ in the heavenly places,"
"21  far above every government and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named,+ not only in this system of things* but also in that to come."
"22  he also subjected all things under his feet+ and made him head over all things with regard to the congregation,+"
"23  which is his body,+ the fullness of him who fills up all things in all."
"2  furthermore, god made you alive, though you were dead in your trespasses and sins,+"
"2  in which you at one time walked according to the system of things* of this world,+ according to the ruler of the authority of the air,+ the spirit+ that is now at work in the sons of disobedience."
"3  yes, among them we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh,+ carrying out the will of the flesh and of our thoughts,+ and we were naturally children of wrath+ just as the rest."
"4  but god, being rich in mercy,+ because of his great love with which he loved us,+"
"5  made us alive together with the christ, even when we were dead in trespasses+—by undeserved kindness you have been saved."
"6  moreover, he raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenly places in union with christ jesus,+"
7  so that in the coming systems of things* he might demonstrate the surpassing riches of his undeserved kindness in his graciousness* toward us in union with christ jesus. 
"8  by this undeserved kindness you have been saved through faith,+ and this is not of your own doing; rather, it is god’s gift."
"9  no, it is not a result of works,+ so that no one should have grounds for boasting."
"10  we are god’s handiwork* and were created+ in union with christ jesus+ for good works, which god determined in advance for us to walk in them. "
"11  therefore, remember that at one time you, people of the nations by fleshly descent, were the ones called “uncircumcision” by those called “circumcision,” which is made in the flesh by human hands."
"12  at that time you were without christ, alienated from the state of israel, strangers to the covenants of the promise;+ you had no hope and were without god in the world.+"
"13  but now in union with christ jesus, you who were once far off have come to be near by the blood of the christ."
"14  for he is our peace,+ the one who made the two groups one+ and destroyed the wall in between that fenced them off.+"
"15  by means of his flesh he abolished the enmity, the law of commandments consisting in decrees, in order to make the two groups in union with himself into one new man+ and to make peace,"
"16  and to reconcile fully both peoples in one body to god through the torture stake,*+ because he had killed off the enmity+ by means of himself."
"17  and he came and declared the good news of peace to you who were far off, and peace to those near,"
"18  because through him we, both peoples, have free access to the father by one spirit. "
"19  so you are no longer strangers and foreigners,+ but you are fellow citizens+ of the holy ones and are members of the household of god,+"
"20  and you have been built up on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,+ while christ jesus himself is the foundation cornerstone.+"
"21  in union with him the whole building, being harmoniously joined together,+ is growing into a holy temple for jehovah.*+"
22  in union with him you too are being built up together into a place for god to inhabit by spirit.+
"4  therefore i, the prisoner+ in the lord, appeal to you to walk worthily+ of the calling with which you were called,"
"2  with all humility*+ and mildness, with patience,+ putting up with one another in love,+"
3  earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.+
"4  one body there is,+ and one spirit,+ just as you were called to the one hope+ of your calling;"
"5  one lord,+ one faith, one baptism;"
"6  one god and father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. "
7  now undeserved kindness was given to each one of us according to how the christ measured out the free gift.+
8  for it says: “when he ascended on high he carried away captives; he gave gifts in men.”+
"9  now what does the expression “he ascended” mean but that he also descended into the lower regions, that is, the earth?"
"10  the very one who descended is also the one who ascended+ far above all the heavens,+ so that he might give fullness to all things. "
"11  and he gave some as apostles,+ some as prophets,+ some as evangelizers,*+ some as shepherds and teachers,+"
"12  with a view to the readjustment* of the holy ones, for ministerial work, to build up the body of the christ,+"
"13  until we all attain to the oneness* of the faith and of the accurate knowledge of the son of god, to being a full-grown* man,+ attaining the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the christ."
"14  so we should no longer be children, tossed about as by waves and carried here and there by every wind of teaching+ by means of the trickery of men, by means of cunning in deceptive schemes."
"15  but speaking the truth, let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, christ.+"
"16  from him all the body+ is harmoniously joined together and made to cooperate through every joint that gives what is needed. when each respective member functions properly, this contributes to the growth of the body as it builds itself up in love.+ "
"17  so this is what i say and bear witness to in the lord, that you should no longer go on walking just as the nations also walk,+ in the futility* of their minds.+"
"18  they are in darkness mentally and alienated from the life that belongs to god, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the insensitivity* of their hearts."
"19  having gone past all moral sense, they gave themselves over to brazen conduct*+ to practice every sort of uncleanness with greediness. "
"20  but you did not learn the christ to be like this,"
"21  if, indeed, you heard him and were taught by means of him, just as truth is in jesus."
22  you were taught to put away the old personality+ that conforms to your former course of conduct and that is being corrupted according to its deceptive desires.+
"23  and you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude,*+"
24  and should put on the new personality+ that was created according to god’s will in true righteousness and loyalty. 
"25  therefore, now that you have put away deceit, each one of you speak truth with his neighbor,+ because we are members belonging to one another.+"
"26  be wrathful, but do not sin;+ do not let the sun set while you are still angry;+"
27  do not give the devil an opportunity.*+
"28  let the one who steals steal no more; rather, let him do hard work, doing good work with his hands,+ so that he may have something to share with someone in need.+"
"29  let a rotten word not come out of your mouth,+ but only what is good for building up as the need may be, to impart what is beneficial to the hearers.+"
"30  also, do not be grieving* god’s holy spirit,+ with which you have been sealed+ for a day of releasing by ransom.+ "
"31  put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness,+ anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech,+ as well as everything injurious.+"
"32  but become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate,+ freely forgiving one another just as god also by christ freely forgave you.+"
"6  children, be obedient to your parents+ in union with the lord, for this is righteous."
2  “honor your father and your mother”+ is the first command with a promise:
3  “that it may go well with you* and you may remain a long time on the earth.”
"4  and fathers, do not be irritating your children,+ but go on bringing them up in the discipline+ and admonition* of jehovah.*+ "
"5  slaves, be obedient to your human* masters,+ with fear and trembling in the sincerity of your hearts, as to the christ,"
"6  not only when being watched, just to please men,*+ but as christ’s slaves doing the will of god whole-souled.*+"
"7  slave with a good attitude, as to jehovah*+ and not to men,"
"8  for you know that whatever good each one does, he will receive this back from jehovah,*+ whether he is a slave or a freeman."
"9  also, you masters, keep treating them in the same way, not threatening, for you know that both their master and yours is in the heavens,+ and there is no partiality with him. "
"10  finally, go on acquiring power+ in the lord and in the mightiness of his strength."
11  put on the complete suit of armor+ from god so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts* of the devil;
"12  because we have a struggle,*+ not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces+ in the heavenly places."
"13  for this reason take up the complete suit of armor from god,+ so that you may be able to resist in the wicked day and, after you have accomplished everything, to stand firm. "
"14  stand firm, therefore, with the belt of truth fastened around your waist,+ wearing the breastplate of righteousness,+"
15  and having your feet shod in readiness to declare the good news of peace.+
"16  besides all of this, take up the large shield of faith,+ with which you will be able to extinguish all the wicked one’s burning arrows.*+"
"17  also, accept the helmet of salvation,+ and the sword of the spirit, that is, god’s word,+"
"18  while with every form of prayer+ and supplication you carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit.+ and to that end stay awake, constantly making supplication in behalf of all the holy ones."
"19  pray also for me, that the words may be given to me when i open my mouth, so that i may be able to speak boldly in making known the sacred secret of the good news,+"
"20  for which i am acting as an ambassador+ in chains, and that i may speak about it with boldness, as i ought to speak. "
"21  now so that you may also know about me and how i am doing, tychʹi·cus,+ a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord, will make everything known to you.+"
"22  i am sending him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know how we are and that he may comfort your hearts. "
23  may the brothers have peace and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ.
24  may the undeserved kindness be with all those loving our lord jesus christ in incorruptness.
"5  therefore, become imitators of god,+ as beloved children,"
"2  and go on walking in love,+ just as the christ also loved us*+ and gave himself for us* as an offering and a sacrifice, a sweet fragrance to god.+ "
"3  let sexual immorality* and every sort of uncleanness or greediness not even be mentioned among you,+ just as is proper for holy people;+"
4  neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jesting+—things that are not befitting—but rather the giving of thanks.+
"5  for you know this, recognizing it for yourselves, that no sexually immoral person*+ or unclean person or greedy person,+ which means being an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of the christ and of god.+ "
"6  let no man deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of god is coming upon the sons of disobedience."
"7  therefore, do not be sharers with them;"
"8  for you were once darkness, but you are now light+ in connection with the lord.+ go on walking as children of light,"
9  for the fruitage of the light consists of every sort of goodness and righteousness and truth.+
10  keep on making sure of what is acceptable+ to the lord;
"11  and stop sharing in the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness;+ rather, expose them for what they are."
12  for the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention.
"13  now all the things that are being exposed* are made evident by the light, for everything that is being made evident is light."
"14  therefore, it is said: “awake, o sleeper, and arise from the dead,+ and the christ will shine upon you.”+ "
"15  so keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons,"
"16  making the best use of your time,*+ because the days are wicked."
"17  on this account stop being unreasonable, but keep perceiving what the will of jehovah* is.+"
"18  also, do not get drunk with wine,+ in which there is debauchery,* but keep getting filled with spirit."
"19  speak to one another* with psalms, praises to god, and spiritual songs, singing+ and accompanying yourselves with music+ in your hearts to jehovah,*+"
20  always giving thanks+ to our god and father for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ.+ 
21  be in subjection to one another+ in fear of christ.
"22  let wives be in subjection to their husbands+ as to the lord,"
"23  because a husband is head of his wife+ just as the christ is head of the congregation,+ he being a savior of this body."
"24  in fact, as the congregation is in subjection to the christ, wives should also be to their husbands in everything."
"25  husbands, continue loving your wives,+ just as the christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it,+"
"26  in order that he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the word,+"
"27  so that he might present the congregation to himself in its splendor, without a spot or a wrinkle or any of such things,+ but holy and without blemish.+ "
"28  in the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. a man who loves his wife loves himself,"
"29  for no man ever hated his own body,* but he feeds and cherishes it, just as the christ does the congregation,"
30  because we are members of his body.+
"31  “for this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to* his wife, and the two will be one flesh.”+"
32  this sacred secret+ is great. now i am speaking about christ and the congregation.+
"33  nevertheless, each one of you must love his wife+ as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband.+"
"3  finally, my brothers, continue rejoicing in the lord.+ it is not troublesome for me to write the same things to you, and it is for your safety. "
2  look out for the dogs; look out for those who cause injury; look out for those who mutilate the flesh.+
"3  for we are those with the real circumcision,+ we who are rendering sacred service by god’s spirit and boasting in christ jesus+ and who do not base our confidence in the flesh,"
"4  though i, if anyone, do have grounds for confidence in the flesh. if any other man thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, i have more:"
"5  circumcised the eighth day,+ of the nation of israel, of the tribe of benjamin, a hebrew born from hebrews;+ regarding law, a pharisee;+"
"6  regarding zeal, persecuting the congregation;+ regarding righteousness based on law, one who proved himself blameless."
"7  yet, the things that were gains to me, i have considered loss* on account of the christ.+"
"8  what is more, i do indeed also consider all things to be loss on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord. for his sake i have taken the loss of all things and i consider them as a lot of refuse,* that i may gain christ"
"9  and be found in union with him, not because of my own righteousness from following the law, but because of the righteousness that is through faith+ in christ,+ the righteousness from god based on faith.+"
"10  my aim is to know him and the power of his resurrection+ and to share in his sufferings,+ submitting myself to a death like his,+"
11  to see if at all possible i may attain to the earlier resurrection from the dead.+ 
"12  not that i have already received it or am already made perfect, but i am pressing on+ to see if i may also lay hold on that for which christ jesus selected me.*+"
"13  brothers, i do not yet consider myself as having taken hold of it; but one thing is certain: forgetting the things behind+ and stretching forward to the things ahead,+"
14  i am pressing on toward the goal for the prize+ of the upward call+ of god by means of christ jesus.
"15  therefore, let those of us who are mature+ be of this mental attitude, and if you are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect, god will reveal the above attitude to you."
"16  at any rate, to the extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same course. "
"17  unitedly become imitators of me,+ brothers, and keep your eye on those who are walking in a way that is in harmony with the example we set for you."
18  for there are many—i used to mention them often but now i mention them also with weeping—who are walking as enemies of the torture stake* of the christ.
"19  their end is destruction, and their god is their belly, and their glory is really their shame, and they have their minds on earthly things.+"
"20  but our citizenship+ exists in the heavens,+ and we are eagerly waiting for a savior from there, the lord jesus christ,+"
21  who will transform our humble body to be like* his glorious body+ by his great power that enables him to subject all things to himself.+
"1  paul and timothy, slaves of christ jesus, to all the holy ones in union with christ jesus who are in phi·lipʹpi,+ along with overseers and ministerial servants:+ "
3  i thank my god always when i remember you
"4  in every supplication of mine for all of you. i offer each supplication with joy,+"
5  because of the contribution you have made to* the good news from the first day until this moment.
"6  for i am confident of this very thing, that the one who started a good work in you will bring it to completion+ until the day of christ jesus.+"
"7  it is only right for me to think this regarding all of you, since i have you in my heart, you who are sharers with me in the undeserved kindness both in my prison bonds+ and in the defending and legally establishing of the good news.+ "
8  for god is my witness of how i am longing for all of you with such tender affection as christ jesus has.
"9  and this is what i continue praying, that your love may abound still more and more+ with accurate knowledge+ and full discernment;+"
"10  that you may make sure of the more important things,+ so that you may be flawless and not stumbling others+ up to the day of christ;"
"11  and that you may be filled with righteous fruit, which is through jesus christ,+ to god’s glory and praise. "
"12  now i want you to know, brothers, that my situation has actually turned out for the advancement of the good news,"
13  so that my prison bonds+ for the sake of christ have become public knowledge+ among all the prae·toʹri·an guard and all the rest.
"14  now most of the brothers in the lord have gained confidence because of my prison bonds, and they are showing all the more courage to speak the word of god fearlessly. "
"15  true, some are preaching the christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill."
"16  the latter are proclaiming the christ out of love, for they know that i have been appointed to defend the good news;+"
"17  but the former do it out of contentiousness, not with a pure motive, for they are intending to create trouble for me in my prison bonds."
"18  with what result? only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, christ is being proclaimed, and i rejoice over this. in fact, i will also keep on rejoicing,"
19  for i know that this will result in my salvation through your supplication+ and with the support of the spirit of jesus christ.+
"20  this is in harmony with my eager expectation and hope that i will not be ashamed in any respect, but that with all freeness of speech christ will now, as always before, be magnified by means of my body, whether through life or through death.+ "
"21  for in my case, to live is christ+ and to die is gain.+"
"22  now if i am to live on in the flesh, this is a fruitage of my work; yet what i would choose, i do not make known."
"23  i am torn between these two things, for i do desire the releasing and the being with christ,+ which is, to be sure, far better.+"
"24  however, it is more necessary for me to remain in the flesh for your sakes."
"25  so, being confident of this, i know i will remain and continue with all of you for your advancement and your joy in the faith,"
26  so that your exultation may overflow in christ jesus because of me when i am again present with you. 
"27  only behave* in a manner worthy of the good news about the christ,+ so that whether i come and see you or i am absent, i may hear about you and learn that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul,*+ striving side by side for the faith of the good news,"
"28  and in no way being frightened by your opponents. this very thing is a proof of destruction+ for them, but of salvation for you;+ and this is from god."
"29  for you have been given the privilege in behalf of christ, not only to put your faith in him but also to suffer in his behalf.+"
"30  for you are facing the same struggle that you saw me face,+ which you now hear that i am still facing."
"2  if, then, there is any encouragement in christ, if any consolation of love, if any spiritual fellowship,* if any tender affection and compassion,"
"2  make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love, being completely united,* having the one thought in mind.+"
"3  do nothing out of contentiousness+ or out of egotism,+ but with humility* consider others superior to you,+"
"4  as you look out not only for your own interests,+ but also for the interests of others.+ "
"5  keep this mental attitude in you that was also in christ jesus,+"
"6  who, although he was existing in god’s form,+ gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to god.+"
"7  no, but he emptied himself and took a slave’s form+ and became human.*+"
"8  more than that, when he came as a man,* he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death,+ yes, death on a torture stake.*+"
"9  for this very reason, god exalted him to a superior position+ and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name,+"
10  so that in the name of jesus every knee should bend—of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground+—
11  and every tongue should openly acknowledge that jesus christ is lord+ to the glory of god the father. 
"12  consequently, my beloved ones, just as you have always obeyed, not only during my presence but now much more readily during my absence, keep working out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
"13  for god is the one who for the sake of his good pleasure energizes you, giving you both the desire and the power to act."
"14  keep doing all things free from murmuring+ and arguments,+"
"15  so that you may come to be blameless and innocent, children of god+ without a blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation,+ among whom you are shining as illuminators in the world,+"
"16  keeping a tight grip on the word of life.+ then i may have reason for rejoicing in christ’s day, knowing that i did not run in vain or work hard in vain."
"17  however, even if i am being poured out like a drink offering+ on the sacrifice+ and the holy service* to which your faith has led you, i am glad and i rejoice with all of you."
"18  in the same way, you also should be glad and rejoice with me. "
"19  now i am hoping in the lord jesus to send timothy+ to you shortly, so that i may be encouraged when i receive news about you."
20  for i have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for your concerns.
"21  for all the others are seeking their own interests, not those of jesus christ."
"22  but you know the proof he gave of himself, that like a child+ with a father he slaved with me to advance the good news."
"23  therefore, he is the one i am hoping to send just as soon as i see how things turn out for me."
"24  indeed, i am confident in the lord that i myself will also come soon.+ "
"25  but for now i consider it necessary to send to you e·paph·ro·diʹtus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your envoy and personal servant for my need,+"
26  since he is longing to see all of you and is depressed because you heard he had fallen sick.
"27  indeed, he did fall sick nearly to the point of death; but god had mercy on him, in fact, not only on him but also on me, so that i should not have one grief after another."
"28  therefore, i am sending him with the greatest urgency, so that when you see him you may again rejoice and i may also be less anxious."
"29  so give him the customary welcome in the lord with all joy, and keep holding men of that sort dear,+"
"30  because he nearly died on account of the work of christ,* risking his life* in order to make up for your not being here to render personal service to me.+"
"4  consequently, my brothers whom i love and long for, my joy and crown,+ stand firm+ in this way in the lord, my beloved ones. "
2  i urge eu·oʹdi·a and i urge synʹty·che to be of the same mind in the lord.+
"3  yes, i request you also, as a true fellow worker,* to keep assisting these women who have striven* side by side with me for the good news, along with clement as well as the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.+ "
"4  always rejoice in the lord. again i will say, rejoice!+"
5  let your reasonableness+ become known to all men. the lord is near.
"6  do not be anxious over anything,+ but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to god;+"
7  and the peace+ of god that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts+ and your mental powers* by means of christ jesus. 
"8  finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern, whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chaste,* whatever things are lovable, whatever things are well-spoken-of, whatever things are virtuous, and whatever things are praiseworthy, continue considering* these things.+"
"9  the things that you learned as well as accepted and heard and saw in connection with me, practice these,+ and the god of peace will be with you. "
"10  i rejoice greatly in the lord that now at last you have renewed your concern for me.+ though you were concerned about me, you lacked opportunity to show it."
"11  not that i am saying this because i am in need, for i have learned to be self-sufficient* regardless of my circumstances.+"
"12  i know how to be low on provisions+ and how to have an abundance. in everything and in all circumstances i have learned the secret of both how to be full and how to hunger, both how to have an abundance and how to do without."
13  for all things i have the strength through the one who gives me power.+ 
"14  nevertheless, you did well to share with me in my tribulation."
"15  in fact, you phi·lipʹpi·ans also know that after you first learned the good news, when i departed from mac·e·doʹni·a, not a congregation shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you alone;+"
"16  for while i was in thes·sa·lo·niʹca, you sent something to me for my need not just once but twice."
"17  not that i am looking for a gift, but i want the fruitage that brings more credit to your account."
"18  however, i have everything i need and even more. i am fully supplied, now that i have received from e·paph·ro·diʹtus+ what you sent, a sweet fragrance,+ an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to god."
19  in turn my god will fully supply all your need+ according to his riches in glory by means of christ jesus.
20  now to our god and father be the glory forever and ever. amen. 
21  give my greetings to every holy one in union with christ jesus. the brothers who are with me send you their greetings.
"22  all the holy ones, but especially those of the household of caesar,+ send you their greetings. "
23  the undeserved kindness of the lord jesus christ be with the spirit you show.
"3  if, however, you were raised up with the christ,+ go on seeking the things above, where the christ is seated at the right hand of god.+"
"2  keep your minds fixed on the things above,+ not on the things on the earth.+"
"3  for you died, and your life has been hidden with the christ in union with god."
"4  when the christ, our life,+ is made manifest, then you also will be made manifest with him in glory.+ "
"5  deaden, therefore, your body members+ that are on the earth as respects sexual immorality,* uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion,+ hurtful desire, and greediness, which is idolatry."
6  on account of those things the wrath of god is coming.
7  that is how you too used to conduct yourselves* in your former way of life.*+
"8  but now you must put them all away from you: wrath, anger, badness,+ abusive speech,+ and obscene talk+ out of your mouth."
"9  do not lie to one another.+ strip off the old personality*+ with its practices,"
"10  and clothe yourselves with the new personality,+ which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the one who created it,+"
"11  where there is neither greek nor jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, foreigner, scythʹi·an,* slave, or freeman; but christ is all things and in all.+ "
"12  accordingly, as god’s chosen ones,+ holy and loved, clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion,+ kindness, humility,*+ mildness,+ and patience.+"
"13  continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely+ even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.+ just as jehovah* freely forgave you, you must also do the same.+"
"14  but besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love,+ for it is a perfect bond of union.+ "
"15  also, let the peace of the christ rule in your hearts,*+ for you were called to that peace in one body. and show yourselves thankful."
"16  let the word of the christ reside in you richly in all wisdom. keep on teaching and encouraging* one another with psalms,+ praises to god, spiritual songs sung with gratitude,* singing in your hearts to jehovah.*+"
"17  whatever it is that you do in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the lord jesus, thanking god the father through him.+ "
"18  you wives, be in subjection to your husbands,+ as it is becoming in the lord."
"19  you husbands, keep on loving your wives+ and do not be bitterly angry* with them.+"
"20  you children, be obedient to your parents in everything,+ for this is well-pleasing to the lord."
"21  you fathers, do not be exasperating* your children,+ so that they do not become downhearted.*"
"22  you slaves, be obedient in everything to those who are your human* masters,+ not only when they are watching, just to please men,* but with sincerity of heart, with fear of jehovah.*"
"23  whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled* as for jehovah,*+ and not for men,"
"24  for you know that it is from jehovah* you will receive the inheritance as a reward.+ slave for the master, christ."
"25  certainly the one who does wrong will be repaid for the wrong he has done,+ and there is no partiality.+"
"1  paul, an apostle of christ jesus through god’s will, and timothy+ our brother,"
2  to the holy ones and faithful brothers in union with christ at co·losʹsae: may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god our father. 
"3  we always thank god, the father of our lord jesus christ, when we pray for you,"
4  since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and the love you have for all the holy ones
5  because of the hope that is being reserved for you in the heavens.+ you previously heard about this hope through the message of truth of the good news
"6  that has come to you. just as the good news is bearing fruit and increasing in all the world,+ so it is also doing among you from the day you heard and accurately knew the undeserved kindness of god in truth."
"7  that is what you have learned from our beloved fellow slave epʹa·phras,+ who is a faithful minister of the christ on our behalf."
8  he also made known to us your love in a spiritual way.* 
"9  that is also why from the day we heard of it, we have never stopped praying for you+ and asking that you may be filled with the accurate knowledge+ of his will in all wisdom and spiritual comprehension,+"
10  so as to walk worthily of jehovah* in order to please him fully as you go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of god;+
"11  and may you be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might+ so that you may endure fully with patience and joy,"
"12  as you thank the father, who made you qualify to share in the inheritance of the holy ones+ in the light. "
"13  he rescued us from the authority of the darkness+ and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved son,"
"14  by means of whom we have our release by ransom, the forgiveness of our sins.+"
"15  he is the image of the invisible god,+ the firstborn of all creation;+"
"16  because by means of him all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth, the things visible and the things invisible,+ whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. all other things have been created through him+ and for him."
"17  also, he is before all other things,+ and by means of him all other things were made to exist,"
"18  and he is the head of the body, the congregation.+ he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,+ so that he might become the one who is first in all things;"
"19  because god was pleased to have all fullness to dwell in him,+"
"20  and through him to reconcile to himself all other things+ by making peace through the blood+ he shed on the torture stake,* whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens. "
"21  indeed, you who were once alienated and enemies because your minds were on the works that were wicked,"
"22  he has now reconciled by means of that one’s fleshly body through his death, in order to present you holy and unblemished and open to no accusation before him+—"
"23  provided, of course, that you continue in the faith,+ established on the foundation+ and steadfast,+ not being shifted away from the hope of that good news that you heard and that was preached in all creation under heaven.+ of this good news i, paul, became a minister.+ "
"24  i am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake,+ and i am undergoing the tribulations of the christ that are yet lacking in my flesh in behalf of his body,+ which is the congregation.+"
"25  i became a minister of this congregation in accord with the stewardship+ from god that was given to me in your behalf to preach the word of god fully,"
"26  the sacred secret+ that was hidden from the past systems of things*+ and from the past generations. but now it has been revealed to his holy ones,+"
"27  to whom god has been pleased to make known among the nations the glorious riches of this sacred secret,+ which is christ in union with you, the hope of his glory.+"
"28  he is the one we are proclaiming, admonishing everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present every person complete in union with christ.+"
"29  to this end i am indeed working hard, exerting myself with his strength that is operating powerfully within me.+"
2  for i want you to realize how great a struggle i am having in your behalf and in behalf of those at la·o·di·ceʹa+ and in behalf of all those who have not personally seen me.*
"2  this is so that their hearts may be comforted+ and that they may be harmoniously joined together in love+ and may have all the riches that result from the full assurance of their understanding, in order to gain an accurate knowledge of the sacred secret of god, namely, christ.+"
3  carefully concealed in him are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.+
4  i am saying this so that no one may delude you with persuasive arguments.
"5  though i am absent in body, i am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order+ and the firmness of your faith in christ.+ "
"6  therefore, just as you have accepted christ jesus the lord, go on walking in union with him,"
"7  being rooted and built up in him+ and being stabilized in the faith,+ just as you were taught, and overflowing with thanksgiving.+ "
"8  look out that no one takes you captive* by means of the philosophy and empty deception+ according to human tradition, according to the elementary things of the world and not according to christ;"
9  because it is in him that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells bodily.+
"10  so you have acquired a fullness by means of him, the one who is the head of all government and authority.+"
"11  by your relationship with him, you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without hands by stripping off the fleshly body,+ by the circumcision that belongs to the christ.+"
"12  for you were buried with him in his baptism,+ and by your relationship with him you were also raised up+ together through your faith in the powerful work of god, who raised him up from the dead.+ "
"13  furthermore, though you were dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcised state of your flesh, god made you alive together with him.+ he kindly forgave us all our trespasses+"
14  and erased* the handwritten document+ that consisted of decrees+ and was in opposition to us.+ he has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the torture stake.*+
"15  he has stripped the governments and the authorities bare and has publicly exhibited them as conquered,+ leading them in a triumphal procession by means of it.* "
"16  therefore, do not let anyone judge you about what you eat and drink+ or about the observance of a festival or of the new moon+ or of a sabbath.+"
"17  those things are a shadow of the things to come,+ but the reality belongs to the christ.+"
"18  let no man deprive you of the prize+ who takes delight in a false humility and a form of worship of the angels, “taking his stand on”* the things he has seen. he is actually puffed up without proper cause by his fleshly frame of mind,"
"19  and he is not holding fast to the head,+ to the one through whom the whole body is supplied and harmoniously joined together by means of its joints and ligaments and made to grow with the growth that is from god.+ "
"20  if you died together with christ with respect to the elementary things of the world,+ why do you live as if still part of the world by further subjecting yourselves to the decrees:+"
"21  “do not handle, nor taste, nor touch,”"
"22  referring to things that all perish with their use, according to the commands and teachings of men?+"
"23  although those things have an appearance of wisdom in a self-imposed form of worship and a false humility, a harsh treatment of the body,+ they are of no value in combating the satisfying of the flesh."
"4  you masters, treat your slaves in a righteous and fair way, knowing that you also have a master in heaven.+ "
"2  persevere in prayer,+ remaining awake in it with thanksgiving.+"
"3  at the same time, pray also for us,+ that god may open a door for the word so that we can declare the sacred secret about the christ, for which i am in prison bonds,+"
4  and that i may proclaim it as clearly as i ought to. 
"5  go on walking in wisdom toward those on the outside, making the best use of your time.*+"
"6  let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt,+ so that you will know how you should answer each person.+ "
"7  tychʹi·cus,+ my beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow slave in the lord, will tell you all the news about me."
8  i am sending him to you so that you will know how we are and that he may comfort your hearts.
"9  he is coming along with o·nesʹi·mus,+ my faithful and beloved brother, who is from among you; they will tell you all the things happening here. "
"10  ar·is·tarʹchus,+ my fellow captive, sends you his greetings, and so does mark,+ the cousin of barʹna·bas (concerning whom you received instructions to welcome him+ if he comes to you),"
"11  and jesus who is called justus, who are of those circumcised. only these are my fellow workers for the kingdom of god, and they have become a source of great comfort* to me."
"12  epʹa·phras,+ a slave of christ jesus who is from among you, sends you his greetings. he is always exerting himself in your behalf in his prayers, so that you may finally stand complete and with firm conviction in all the will of god."
13  for i bear him witness that he makes great efforts in your behalf and in behalf of those in la·o·di·ceʹa and hi·e·rapʹo·lis. 
"14  luke,+ the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and so does deʹmas.+"
15  give my greetings to the brothers in la·o·di·ceʹa and to nymʹpha and to the congregation at her house.+
"16  and when this letter has been read among you, arrange for it also to be read+ in the congregation of the la·o·di·ceʹans and for you also to read the one from la·o·di·ceʹa."
"17  also, tell ar·chipʹpus:+ “pay attention to the ministry that you accepted in the lord, in order to fulfill it.” "
"18  here is my greeting, paul’s, in my own hand.+ keep my prison bonds+ in mind. the undeserved kindness be with you."
"3  so when we could bear it no longer, we thought it best to stay on alone in athens;+"
"2  and we sent timothy,+ our brother and god’s minister* in the good news about the christ, to make you firm* and comfort you regarding your faith,"
3  so that no one might be shaken* by these tribulations. for you yourselves know that we cannot avoid suffering such things.*+
"4  for when we were with you, we used to tell you in advance that we would suffer tribulation, and that is what has happened, just as you know.+"
"5  that is why, when i could bear it no longer, i sent to learn of your faithfulness,+ in case somehow the tempter+ might have tempted you, and our labor might have turned out to be in vain. "
"6  but timothy has just now come to us from you+ and has given us the good news about your faithfulness and love, that you always continue to remember us fondly and that you long to see us in the same way as we also do you."
"7  that is why, brothers, in all our distress* and tribulation, we have been comforted because of you and the faithfulness you demonstrate.+"
8  because we are revitalized* if you are standing firm in the lord.
9  for how can we show our thanks to god concerning you in return for the great joy we feel before our god on your account?
10  night and day we make supplications as earnestly as we can to see you in person* and to supply what is lacking in your faith.+ 
11  now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus make a way for us to come to you.
"12  moreover, may the lord cause you to increase, yes, to abound in love for one another+ and for all, just as we do for you,"
"13  so that he may make your hearts firm, blameless in holiness before our god+ and father at the presence of our lord jesus+ with all his holy ones."
"1  paul, sil·vaʹnus,*+ and timothy,+ to the congregation of the thes·sa·loʹni·ans in union with god the father and the lord jesus christ: may you have undeserved kindness and peace. "
"2  we always thank god when we mention all of you in our prayers,+"
"3  for we continually remember your faithful work, your loving labor, and your endurance because of your hope+ in our lord jesus christ in the presence of our god and father."
"4  for we know, brothers loved by god, his choosing of you,"
"5  because the good news we preach did not come to you with speech alone but also with power and with holy spirit and with strong conviction, just as you know what sort of men we became among you for your sakes."
"6  and you became imitators of us+ and of the lord,+ seeing that you accepted the word under much tribulation+ with joy of holy spirit,"
7  so that you became an example to all the believers in mac·e·doʹni·a and in a·chaʹia. 
"8  the fact is, not only has the word of jehovah* sounded out from you in mac·e·doʹni·a and a·chaʹia but your faith in god has spread abroad in every place,+ so that we do not need to say anything."
"9  for they themselves keep reporting about our first contact with you and how you turned to god from your idols+ to slave for a living and true god,"
"10  and to wait for his son from the heavens,+ whom he raised up from the dead, namely, jesus, who rescues us from the wrath that is coming.+"
"2  you yourselves surely know, brothers, that our visit to you has not been without results.+"
"2  for although we had first suffered and been insolently treated in phi·lipʹpi,+ as you know, we mustered up boldness* by means of our god to tell you the good news of god+ in the face of much opposition.*"
"3  for the exhortation we give does not spring from error or from uncleanness or with deceit,"
"4  but just as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak to please, not men, but god, who examines our hearts.+ "
"5  in fact, you know that we never used flattering speech or put on any false front with greedy motives;+ god is witness!"
"6  nor have we been seeking glory from men, either from you or from others, though we could be an expensive burden as apostles of christ.+"
"7  on the contrary, we became gentle in your midst, as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for* her own children."
"8  so having tender affection for you, we were determined* to impart to you, not only the good news of god but also our very selves,*+ because you became so beloved to us.+ "
"9  surely you remember, brothers, our labor and toil. we were working night and day, so that we would not put an expensive burden on any one of you,+ when we preached the good news of god to you."
"10  you are witnesses, god is also, of how loyal and righteous and blameless we behaved toward you believers."
"11  you well know that we kept exhorting and consoling you and bearing witness to each one of you,+ just as a father+ does his children,"
"12  so that you would go on walking worthily of god,+ who is calling you to his kingdom+ and glory.+ "
"13  indeed, that is why we also thank god unceasingly,+ because when you received god’s word, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of god, which is also at work in you believers."
"14  for you, brothers, became imitators of the congregations of god in union with christ jesus that are in ju·deʹa, because you suffered at the hands of your own countrymen+ the same things that they also are suffering at the hands of the jews,"
"15  who even killed the lord jesus+ and the prophets and persecuted us.+ furthermore, they are not pleasing god, but are against the interests of all men,"
16  as they try to prevent us from speaking to people of the nations so that these might be saved.+ in this way they always fill up the measure of their sins. but his wrath has at last come upon them.+ 
"17  but when we were separated from* you, brothers, for just a short time (in person, not in our hearts), because of our strong desire, we made every effort to see you in person.*"
"18  for this reason we wanted to come to you, yes i, paul, tried not just once but twice; yet satan cut across our path."
19  for what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation before our lord jesus at his presence? is it not in fact you?+
20  you certainly are our glory and joy.
"4  finally, brothers, just as you received instruction from us on how you should walk in order to please god,+ just as you are in fact walking, we request you and appeal to you by the lord jesus to keep doing it more fully."
2  for you know the instructions* we gave you through the lord jesus. 
"3  for this is the will of god, that you should be holy+ and abstain from sexual immorality.*+"
"4  each one of you should know how to control his own body*+ in holiness+ and honor,"
"5  not with greedy, uncontrolled sexual passion+ like the nations have that do not know god.+"
"6  no one should go beyond proper limits and take advantage of his brother in this matter, because jehovah* exacts punishment for all these things, just as we told you previously and also strongly warned you."
"7  for god has called us, not for uncleanness, but for holiness.+"
"8  so, then, the man who disregards this is disregarding, not man, but god,+ who gives you his holy spirit.+ "
"9  however, concerning brotherly love,+ you do not need us to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by god to love one another.+"
"10  in fact, you are doing so toward all the brothers in all of mac·e·doʹni·a. but we urge you, brothers, to go on doing so in fuller measure."
"11  make it your aim to live quietly+ and to mind your own business+ and to work with your hands,+ just as we instructed you,"
12  so that you may walk decently in the eyes of people outside+ and not need anything. 
"13  moreover, brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant* about those who are sleeping in death,+ so that you may not sorrow as the rest do who have no hope.+"
"14  for if we have faith that jesus died and rose again,+ so too god will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in death through jesus.+"
"15  for this is what we tell you by jehovah’s* word, that we the living who survive to the presence of the lord will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep in death;"
"16  because the lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s+ voice and with god’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with christ will rise first.+"
"17  afterward we the living who are surviving will, together with them, be caught away in clouds+ to meet the lord+ in the air; and thus we will always be with the lord.+"
18  so keep comforting one another with these words.
"5  now as for the times and the seasons, brothers, you need nothing to be written to you."
2  for you yourselves know very well that jehovah’s* day+ is coming exactly as a thief in the night.+
"3  whenever it is that they are saying, “peace and security!” then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them,+ just like birth pains on a pregnant woman, and they will by no means escape."
"4  but you, brothers, you are not in darkness, so that the day should overtake you as it would thieves,"
5  for you are all sons of light and sons of day.+ we belong neither to night nor to darkness.+ 
"6  so, then, let us not sleep on as the rest do,+ but let us stay awake+ and keep our senses.+"
"7  for those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.+"
"8  but as for us who belong to the day, let us keep our senses and put on the breastplate of faith and love and the hope of salvation as a helmet+"
"9  because god assigned us, not to wrath, but to the acquiring of salvation+ through our lord jesus christ."
"10  he died for us,+ so that whether we stay awake or are asleep,* we should live together with him.+"
"11  therefore, keep encouraging* one another and building one another up,+ just as you are in fact doing. "
"12  now we request you, brothers, to show respect for those who are working hard among you and presiding over you in the lord and admonishing you;"
13  and to give them extraordinary consideration in love because of their work.+ be peaceable with one another.+
"14  on the other hand, we urge you, brothers, to warn* the disorderly,+ speak consolingly to those who are depressed,* support the weak, be patient toward all.+"
"15  see that no one repays injury for injury to anyone,+ but always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others.+ "
16  always be rejoicing.+
17  pray constantly.+
18  give thanks for everything.+ this is god’s will for you in christ jesus.
19  do not put out the fire of the spirit.+
20  do not treat prophecies with contempt.+
21  make sure of all things;+ hold fast to what is fine.
22  abstain from every form of wickedness.+ 
"23  may the god of peace himself sanctify you completely. and may the spirit and soul* and body of you brothers, sound in every respect, be preserved blameless at the presence of our lord jesus christ.+"
"24  the one who is calling you is faithful, and he will surely do so. "
"25  brothers, keep praying for us.+ "
26  greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 
27  i am putting you under the solemn obligation by the lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.+ 
28  the undeserved kindness of our lord jesus christ be with you.
"3  finally, brothers, carry on prayer for us,+ that the word of jehovah* may keep spreading rapidly+ and being glorified, just as it is with you,"
"2  and that we may be rescued from harmful and wicked men,+ for faith is not a possession of all people.+"
"3  but the lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the wicked one."
"4  moreover, we have confidence in the lord regarding you, that you are carrying out and will go on carrying out our instructions."
5  may the lord continue to guide your hearts successfully to the love of god+ and to the endurance+ for the christ. 
"6  now we are giving you instructions, brothers, in the name of our lord jesus christ, to withdraw from every brother who is walking disorderly+ and not according to the tradition* that you* received from us.+"
"7  for you yourselves know how you should imitate us,+ because we did not behave in a disorderly way among you,"
"8  nor did we eat anyone’s food free.*+ on the contrary, by labor and toil we were working night and day so as not to impose an expensive burden on any one of you.+"
"9  not that we do not have authority,+ but we wanted to offer ourselves as an example for you to imitate.+"
"10  in fact, when we were with you, we used to give you this order: “if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.”+"
"11  for we hear that some are walking disorderly among you,+ not working at all, but meddling with what does not concern them.+"
12  to such people we give the order and exhortation in the lord jesus christ that they should work quietly and eat food they themselves earn.+ 
"13  for your part, brothers, do not give up in doing good."
"14  but if anyone is not obedient to our word through this letter, keep this one marked and stop associating with him,+ so that he may become ashamed."
"15  and yet do not consider him an enemy, but continue admonishing him+ as a brother. "
16  now may the lord of peace himself give you peace constantly in every way.+ may the lord be with all of you. 
"17  here is my greeting, paul’s, in my own hand,+ which is a sign in every letter; this is the way i write. "
18  the undeserved kindness of our lord jesus christ be with all of you.
"1  paul, sil·vaʹnus,* and timothy,+ to the congregation of the thes·sa·loʹni·ans in union with god our father and the lord jesus christ: "
2  may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ. 
"3  we are obligated always to give thanks to god for you, brothers. this is fitting, because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of each and every one of you is increasing toward one another.+"
4  as a result we ourselves take pride in you+ among the congregations of god because of your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the hardships* that you are suffering.*+
"5  this is a proof of the righteous judgment of god, leading to your being counted worthy of the kingdom of god, for which you are indeed suffering.+ "
6  this takes into account that it is righteous on god’s part to repay tribulation to those who make tribulation for you.+
7  but you who suffer tribulation will be given relief along with us at the revelation of the lord jesus+ from heaven with his powerful angels+
"8  in a flaming fire, as he brings vengeance on those who do not know god and those who do not obey the good news about our lord jesus.+"
"9  these very ones will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction+ from before the lord and from the glory of his strength,"
"10  at the time when he comes to be glorified in connection with his holy ones and to be regarded in that day with wonder among all those who exercised faith, because the witness we gave met with faith among you. "
"11  to that very end we always pray for you, that our god may count you worthy of his calling+ and with his power perform completely all the good that he pleases and every work of faith."
"12  this is so that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you in union with him, according to the undeserved kindness of our god and of the lord jesus christ."
"2  however, brothers, concerning the presence of our lord jesus christ+ and our being gathered together to him,+ we ask you"
"2  not to be quickly shaken from your reason nor to be alarmed either by an inspired statement*+ or by a spoken message or by a letter appearing to be from us, to the effect that the day of jehovah*+ is here. "
"3  let no one lead you astray* in any way, because it will not come unless the apostasy+ comes first and the man of lawlessness+ gets revealed, the son of destruction.+"
"4  he stands in opposition and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship,* so that he sits down in the temple of god, publicly showing himself to be a god."
"5  do you not remember that when i was still with you, i used to tell you these things? "
"6  and now you know what is acting as a restraint, so that he will be revealed in his own due time."
"7  true, the mystery of this lawlessness is already at work,+ but only until the one who is right now acting as a restraint is out of the way."
"8  then, indeed, the lawless one will be revealed, whom the lord jesus will do away with by the spirit of his mouth+ and bring to nothing by the manifestation+ of his presence."
9  but the lawless one’s presence is by the operation of satan+ with every powerful work and lying signs and wonders*+
"10  and every unrighteous deception+ for those who are perishing, as a retribution because they did not accept the love of the truth in order that they might be saved."
"11  that is why god lets a deluding influence mislead them so that they may come to believe the lie,+"
12  in order that they all may be judged because they did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness. 
"13  however, we are obligated always to thank god for you, brothers loved by jehovah,* because from the beginning god selected you+ for salvation by sanctifying you+ with his spirit and by your faith in the truth."
"14  he called you to this through the good news we declare, so that you may acquire the glory of our lord jesus christ.+"
"15  so, then, brothers, stand firm+ and maintain your hold on the traditions that you were taught,+ whether it was by a spoken message or by a letter from us."
"16  moreover, may our lord jesus christ himself and god our father, who loved us+ and gave everlasting comfort and good hope+ by means of undeserved kindness,"
17  comfort your hearts and make you firm* in every good deed and word.
"3  this statement is trustworthy: if a man is reaching out to be an overseer,+ he is desirous of a fine work."
"2  the overseer should therefore be irreprehensible, a husband of one wife, moderate in habits, sound in mind,*+ orderly, hospitable,+ qualified to teach,+"
"3  not a drunkard,+ not violent,* but reasonable,+ not quarrelsome,+ not a lover of money,+"
"4  a man presiding over* his own household in a fine manner, having his children in subjection with all seriousness+"
"5  (for if any man does not know how to preside over* his own household, how will he care for the congregation of god?),"
"6  not a newly converted man,+ for fear that he might get puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed on the devil."
"7  moreover, he should also have a fine testimony* from outsiders+ so that he does not fall into reproach* and a snare of the devil. "
"8  ministerial servants should likewise be serious, not double-tongued,* not indulging in a lot of wine, not greedy of dishonest gain,+"
9  holding the sacred secret of the faith with a clean conscience.+ 
"10  also, let these be tested as to fitness* first; then let them serve as ministers, as they are free from accusation.+ "
"11  women should likewise be serious, not slanderous,+ moderate in habits, faithful in all things.+ "
"12  let ministerial servants be husbands of one wife, presiding in a fine manner over their children and their own households."
13  for the men who minister in a fine manner are acquiring for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith that is in christ jesus. 
"14  i am writing you these things, though i am hoping to come to you shortly,"
"15  but in case i am delayed, so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in god’s household,+ which is the congregation of the living god, a pillar and support of the truth."
"16  indeed, the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great: ‘he was made manifest in flesh,+ was declared righteous in spirit,+ appeared to angels,+ was preached about among nations,+ was believed upon in the world,+ was received up in glory.’"
"1  paul, an apostle of christ jesus by the command of god our savior and of christ jesus, our hope,+"
"2  to timothy,*+ a genuine child+ in the faith: may you have undeserved kindness and mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord. "
"3  just as i encouraged you to stay in ephʹe·sus when i was about to go to mac·e·doʹni·a, so i do now, in order for you to command certain ones not to teach different doctrine,"
4  nor to pay attention to false stories+ and to genealogies. such things end up in nothing useful+ but merely give rise to speculations rather than providing anything from god in connection with faith.
"5  really, the objective of this instruction* is love+ out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith+ without hypocrisy."
"6  by deviating from these things, some have been turned aside to meaningless talk.+"
"7  they want to be teachers+ of law, but they do not understand either the things they are saying or the things they insist on so strongly. "
"8  now we know that the law is fine if one applies it properly,*"
"9  recognizing that law is made, not for a righteous man, but for those who are lawless+ and rebellious, ungodly and sinners, disloyal* and profane, murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers,"
"10  sexually immoral people,* men who practice homosexuality,* kidnappers, liars, perjurers,* and everything else that is in opposition to the wholesome* teaching+"
"11  according to the glorious good news of the happy god, with which i was entrusted.+ "
"12  i am grateful to christ jesus our lord, who imparted power to me, because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry,+"
"13  although formerly i was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man.+ nevertheless, i was shown mercy because i acted in ignorance and with a lack of faith."
14  but the undeserved kindness of our lord abounded exceedingly along with faith and the love that is in christ jesus.
"15  this saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance: christ jesus came into the world to save sinners.+ of these, i am foremost.+"
"16  nevertheless, i was shown mercy so that by means of me as the foremost case, christ jesus might demonstrate all his patience, making me an example to those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life.+ "
"17  now to the king of eternity,+ incorruptible,+ invisible,+ the only god,+ be honor and glory forever and ever. amen. "
"18  this instruction* i entrust to you, my child timothy, in harmony with the prophecies that were made about you, that by these you may go on waging the fine warfare,+"
"19  holding faith and a good conscience,+ which some have thrust aside, resulting in the shipwreck of their faith."
"20  hy·me·naeʹus+ and alexander are among these, and i have handed them over to satan+ so that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme."
"2  first of all, then, i urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be made concerning all sorts of men,"
"2  concerning kings and all those who are in high positions,*+ so that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion and seriousness.+"
"3  this is fine and acceptable in the sight of our savior, god,+"
4  whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved+ and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.
"5  for there is one god,+ and one mediator+ between god and men,+ a man, christ jesus,+"
6  who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all*+—this is what is to be witnessed to in its own due time.
"7  for the purpose of this witness+ i was appointed a preacher and an apostle+—i am telling the truth, i am not lying—a teacher of nations+ in the matter of faith and truth. "
"8  so i desire that in every place the men carry on prayer, lifting up loyal hands,+ without anger+ and debates.+"
"9  likewise, the women should adorn themselves in appropriate* dress, with modesty and soundness of mind,* not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing,+"
"10  but in the way that is proper for women professing devotion to god,+ namely, through good works. "
11  let a woman learn in silence* with full submissiveness.+
"12  i do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but she is to remain silent.*+"
"13  for adam was formed first, then eve.+"
"14  also, adam was not deceived, but the woman was thoroughly deceived+ and became a transgressor."
"15  however, she will be kept safe through childbearing,+ provided she* continues in faith and love and holiness along with soundness of mind.*+"
"4  however, the inspired word* clearly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired statements*+ and teachings of demons,"
"2  by means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies,+ whose conscience is seared as with a branding iron."
3  they forbid marriage+ and command people to abstain from foods+ that god created to be partaken of+ with thanksgiving by those who have faith+ and accurately know the truth.
"4  for every creation of god is fine,+ and nothing is to be rejected+ if it is received with thanksgiving,"
5  for it is sanctified through god’s word and prayer over it. 
"6  by giving this counsel to the brothers, you will be a fine minister of christ jesus, one nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching that you have followed closely.+"
"7  but reject irreverent false stories,+ like those told by old women. on the other hand, train yourself with godly devotion as your aim."
"8  for physical training* is beneficial for a little, but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and the life that is to come.+"
9  that statement is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.
"10  this is why we are working hard and exerting ourselves,+ because we have rested our hope on a living god, who is a savior+ of all sorts of men,+ especially of faithful ones. "
11  keep on giving these commands and teaching them.
"12  never let anyone look down on your youth. instead, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.*"
"13  until i come, continue applying yourself to public reading,+ to exhortation,* to teaching."
14  do not neglect the gift in you that was given you through a prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.+
"15  ponder over* these things; be absorbed in them, so that your advancement may be plainly seen by all people."
"16  pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.+ persevere in these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.+"
"6  let those who are under the yoke of slavery keep on considering their owners worthy of full honor,+ so that the name of god and the teaching may never be spoken of injuriously.+"
"2  moreover, let those having believing owners not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers. rather, they should serve more readily, because those receiving the benefit of their good service are believers and beloved. keep on teaching these things and giving these exhortations."
"3  if any man teaches another doctrine and does not agree with the wholesome* instruction,+ which is from our lord jesus christ, nor with the teaching that is in harmony with godly devotion,+"
"4  he is puffed up with pride and does not understand anything.+ he is obsessed* with arguments and debates about words.+ these things give rise to envy, strife, slander,* wicked suspicions,"
"5  constant disputes about minor matters by men who are corrupted in mind+ and deprived of the truth, thinking that godly devotion is a means of gain.+"
"6  to be sure, there is great gain in godly devotion+ along with contentment.*"
"7  for we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out.+"
"8  so, having food* and clothing,* we will be content with these things.+ "
9  but those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare+ and many senseless and harmful desires that plunge men into destruction and ruin.+
"10  for the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.+ "
"11  however, you, o man of god, flee from these things. but pursue righteousness, godly devotion, faith, love, endurance, and mildness.+"
12  fight the fine fight of the faith; get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses. 
"13  before god, who preserves all things alive, and christ jesus, who as a witness made the fine public declaration before pontius pilate,+ i give you orders"
"14  to observe the commandment in a spotless and irreprehensible way until the manifestation of our lord jesus christ,+"
"15  which the happy and only potentate will show in its own appointed times. he is the king of those who rule as kings and lord of those who rule as lords,+"
"16  the one alone having immortality,+ who dwells in unapproachable light,+ whom no man has seen or can see.+ to him be honor and eternal might. amen. "
"17  instruct* those who are rich in the present system of things* not to be arrogant,* and to place their hope, not on uncertain riches,+ but on god, who richly provides us with all the things we enjoy.+"
"18  tell them to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be generous,* ready to share,+"
"19  safely treasuring up for themselves a fine foundation for the future,+ so that they may get a firm hold on the real life.+ "
"20  timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you,+ turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called “knowledge.”+"
"21  by making a show of such knowledge, some have deviated from the faith. may the undeserved kindness be with you."
"5  do not severely criticize an older man.+ on the contrary, appeal to him as a father, to younger men as brothers,"
"2  to older women as mothers, to younger women as sisters, with all chasteness. "
3  give consideration to* widows who are truly widows.*+
"4  but if any widow has children or grandchildren, let these learn first to practice godly devotion in their own household+ and to repay their parents and grandparents what is due them,+ for this is acceptable in god’s sight.+"
5  now the woman who is truly a widow and left destitute has put her hope in god+ and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.+
6  but the one who gives herself to sensual gratification is dead though she is living.
"7  so keep on giving these instructions,* so that they may be irreprehensible."
"8  certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.+ "
"9  a widow is to be put on the list if she is not less than 60 years old, was the wife of one husband,"
"10  having a reputation for fine works,+ if she raised children,+ if she practiced hospitality,+ if she washed the feet of holy ones,+ if she assisted the afflicted,+ if she devoted herself to every good work. "
"11  on the other hand, do not put younger widows on the list, for when their sexual desires come between them and the christ, they want to marry."
12  and they will incur judgment because they have abandoned their first expression of faith.*
"13  at the same time they also learn to be unoccupied, going around from one house to another; yes, not only unoccupied but also gossipers and meddlers in other people’s affairs,+ talking about things they should not."
"14  therefore, i desire the younger widows to marry,+ to bear children,+ to manage a household, to give no opportunity to the opposer to criticize."
"15  in fact, some have already been turned aside to follow satan."
"16  if any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her assist them so that the congregation is not burdened. then it can assist those who are truly widows.*+ "
"17  let the elders who preside in a fine way+ be considered worthy of double honor,+ especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching.+"
"18  for the scripture says, “you must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out the grain,”+ also, “the worker is worthy of his wages.”+"
19  do not accept an accusation against an older man* except on the evidence of two or three witnesses.+
"20  reprove+ before all onlookers those who practice sin,+ as a warning to the rest.*"
21  i solemnly charge you before god and christ jesus and the chosen angels to observe these instructions without any prejudice or partiality.+ 
22  never lay your hands hastily on any man;*+ neither become a sharer in the sins of others; keep yourself chaste. 
"23  do not drink water any longer,* but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness. "
"24  the sins of some men are publicly known, leading directly to judgment, but those of other men become evident later.+"
"25  in the same way also, the fine works are publicly known+ and those that are otherwise cannot be kept hidden.+"
"3  but know this, that in the last days+ critical times hard to deal with will be here."
"2  for men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal,"
"3  having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness,"
"4  betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of god,"
5  having an appearance of godliness but proving false to its power;+ and from these turn away.
"6  from among these arise men who slyly work their way into households and captivate weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires,"
7  always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth. 
"8  now in the way that janʹnes and jamʹbres opposed moses, so these also go on opposing the truth. such men are completely corrupted in mind, disapproved as regards the faith."
"9  nevertheless, they will make no further progress, for their folly* will be very plain to all, as it was with those two men.+"
"10  but you have closely followed my teaching, my course of life,+ my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,"
"11  the persecutions and sufferings such as i experienced in antioch,+ in i·coʹni·um,+ in lysʹtra.+ i endured these persecutions, and the lord rescued me from them all.+"
"12  in fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with christ jesus will also be persecuted.+"
"13  but wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.+ "
"14  you, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe,+ knowing from whom you learned them"
"15  and that from infancy+ you have known the holy writings,+ which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in christ jesus.+"
"16  all scripture is inspired of god+ and beneficial for teaching,+ for reproving, for setting things straight,* for disciplining in righteousness,+"
"17  so that the man of god may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work."
"1  paul, an apostle of christ jesus by god’s will according to the promise of the life that is through christ jesus,+"
"2  to timothy, a beloved child:+ may you have undeserved kindness, mercy, and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord. "
"3  i am grateful to god, to whom i am rendering sacred service as my forefathers did, and with a clean conscience, never ceasing to remember you in my supplications night and day."
"4  as i remember your tears, i am longing to see you, so that i may get filled with joy."
"5  for i recall your unhypocritical faith,+ which dwelled first in your grandmother loʹis and your mother euʹnice, but which i am confident is also in you. "
6  for this reason i remind you to stir up like a fire the gift of god that is in you through the laying of my hands on you.+
"7  for god did not give us a spirit of cowardice,+ but one of power+ and of love and of soundness of mind."
"8  so do not become ashamed either of the witness about our lord+ or of me, a prisoner for his sake, but take your part in suffering adversity+ for the good news by relying on the power of god.+"
"9  he saved us and called us with a holy calling,+ not because of our works, but because of his own purpose and undeserved kindness.+ this was given to us in connection with christ jesus before times long ago,"
"10  but now it has been made clearly evident through the manifestation of our savior, christ jesus,+ who has abolished death+ and has shed light on life+ and incorruption+ through the good news,+"
11  for which i was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher.+ 
"12  this is why i am also suffering these things,+ but i am not ashamed.+ for i know the one whom i have believed, and i am confident that he is able to guard what i have laid up in trust with him until that day.+"
13  keep holding to the standard* of wholesome* words+ that you heard from me with the faith and love that result from union with christ jesus.
"14  guard this fine trust by means of the holy spirit, which is dwelling in us.+ "
"15  you know this, that all the men in the province of asia+ have turned away from me, including phy·gelʹus and her·mogʹe·nes."
"16  may the lord grant mercy to the household of on·e·siphʹo·rus,+ for he often refreshed me, and he did not become ashamed of my prison chains."
"17  on the contrary, when he was in rome, he diligently looked for me and found me."
18  may the lord grant him to find mercy from jehovah* in that day. and you well know all the services he rendered in ephʹe·sus.
"2  you, therefore, my child,+ keep on acquiring power in the undeserved kindness that is in christ jesus;"
"2  and the things you heard from me that were supported by many witnesses,+ these things entrust to faithful men, who, in turn, will be adequately qualified to teach others."
"3  as a fine soldier+ of christ jesus, take your part in suffering adversity.+"
"4  no man serving as a soldier involves himself* in the commercial businesses* of life, in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier."
"5  and even in the games, anyone who competes is not crowned unless he has competed according to the rules.+"
6  the hardworking farmer must be the first to partake of the fruits.
7  give constant thought to what i am saying; the lord will give you understanding* in all things. 
"8  remember that jesus christ was raised up from the dead+ and was david’s offspring,*+ according to the good news i preach,+"
"9  for which i am suffering and being imprisoned as a criminal.+ nevertheless, the word of god is not bound.+"
"10  for this reason i go on enduring all things for the sake of the chosen ones,+ so that they too may obtain the salvation that is through christ jesus, along with everlasting glory."
"11  this saying is trustworthy: certainly if we died together, we will also live together;+"
"12  if we go on enduring, we will also rule together as kings;+ if we deny, he will also deny us;+"
"13  if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself. "
"14  keep reminding them of these things, instructing* them before god not to fight about words, something of no usefulness at all because it harms* those listening."
"15  do your utmost to present yourself approved to god, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.+"
"16  but reject empty speeches that violate what is holy,+ for they will lead to more and more ungodliness,"
17  and their word will spread like gangrene. hy·me·naeʹus and phi·leʹtus are among them.+
"18  these men have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred,+ and they are subverting the faith of some."
"19  despite that, the solid foundation of god remains standing, having this seal, “jehovah* knows those who belong to him,”+ and, “let everyone calling on the name of jehovah*+ renounce unrighteousness.” "
"20  now in a large house there are utensils* not only of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for an honorable use but others for a use lacking honor."
"21  so if anyone keeps clear of the latter ones, he will be an instrument* for an honorable use, sanctified, useful to his owner, prepared for every good work."
"22  so flee from youthful desires, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with those who call on the lord out of a clean heart. "
"23  further, reject foolish and ignorant debates,+ knowing that they produce fights."
"24  for a slave of the lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle* toward all,+ qualified to teach, showing restraint when wronged,+"
"25  instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed.+ perhaps god may give them repentance* leading to an accurate knowledge of truth,+"
"26  and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, seeing that they have been caught alive by him to do his will.+"
"4  i solemnly charge you before god and christ jesus, who is to judge+ the living and the dead,+ and by his manifestation+ and his kingdom:+"
"2  preach the word;+ be at it urgently in favorable times and difficult times; reprove,+ reprimand, exhort, with all patience and art of teaching.+"
"3  for there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome* teaching,+ but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled.*+"
4  they will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.
"5  you, though, keep your senses in all things, endure hardship,+ do the work of an evangelizer,* fully accomplish your ministry.+ "
"6  for i am already being poured out like a drink offering,+ and the time for my releasing+ is imminent."
"7  i have fought the fine fight,+ i have run the race to the finish,+ i have observed the faith."
"8  from this time on, there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness,+ which the lord, the righteous judge,+ will give me as a reward in that day,+ yet not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his manifestation. "
9  do your utmost to come to me shortly.
"10  for deʹmas+ has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things,* and he has gone to thes·sa·lo·niʹca, cresʹcens to ga·laʹti·a, titus to dal·maʹtia."
"11  only luke is with me. bring mark along with you, for he is helpful to me in the ministry."
12  but i have sent tychʹi·cus+ off to ephʹe·sus.
"13  when you come, bring the cloak i left at troʹas with carpus, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.* "
14  alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm. jehovah* will repay him according to his deeds.+
"15  you too should be on guard against him, for he opposed our message to an excessive degree. "
"16  in my first defense no one came to my side, but they all forsook me—may they not be held accountable."
"17  but the lord stood near me and infused power into me, so that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the nations might hear it;+ and i was rescued from the lion’s mouth.+"
18  the lord will rescue me from every wicked work and will save me for his heavenly kingdom.+ to him be the glory forever and ever. amen. 
19  give my greetings to prisʹca and aqʹui·la+ and the household of on·e·siphʹo·rus.+ 
"20  e·rasʹtus+ stayed in corinth, but i left trophʹi·mus+ sick at mi·leʹtus."
"21  do your utmost to arrive before winter. eu·buʹlus sends you his greetings, and so do puʹdens and liʹnus and clauʹdi·a and all the brothers. "
22  the lord be with the spirit you show. his undeserved kindness be with you.
"3  continue reminding them to be in subjection and to be obedient to governments and authorities,+ to be ready for every good work,"
"2  to speak injuriously of no one, not to be quarrelsome, but to be reasonable,+ displaying all mildness toward all men.+"
"3  for we too were once senseless, disobedient, led astray, being slaves to various desires and pleasures, carrying on in badness and envy, detestable, hating one another. "
"4  however, when the kindness of our savior, god,+ and his love for mankind were manifested"
"5  (not because of any righteous works we had done,+ but because of his own mercy),+ he saved us by means of the bath that brought us to life+ and by making us new by holy spirit.+"
"6  he poured this spirit out richly* on us through jesus christ our savior,+"
"7  so that after being declared righteous through the undeserved kindness of that one,+ we might become heirs+ according to a hope of everlasting life.+ "
"8  these words are trustworthy, and i want you to keep stressing these matters, so that those who have believed god may keep their minds focused on maintaining fine works. these things are fine and beneficial to men. "
"9  but have nothing to do with foolish arguments and genealogies and disputes and fights over the law, for they are unprofitable and futile.+"
"10  as for a man who promotes a sect,+ reject him+ after a first and a second admonition,*+"
11  knowing that such a man has deviated from the way and is sinning and is self-condemned. 
"12  when i send arʹte·mas or tychʹi·cus+ to you, do your utmost to come to me at ni·copʹo·lis, for that is where i have decided to spend the winter."
"13  carefully supply zeʹnas, who is versed in the law, and a·polʹlos so that they may lack nothing for their trip.+"
"14  but let our people also learn to maintain fine works so as to help in cases of urgent need,+ so that they may not be unproductive.*+ "
15  all those with me send you their greetings. give my greetings to those who have affection for us in the faith. may the undeserved kindness be with all of you.
"1  paul, a slave of god and an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god’s chosen ones and the accurate knowledge of the truth that is according to godly devotion"
"2  and is based on a hope of the everlasting life+ that god, who cannot lie,+ promised long ago;"
"3  but in his own due time, he made his word known through the preaching entrusted to me+ according to the command of our savior, god;"
"4  to titus, a genuine child according to the faith we share: may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god the father and christ jesus our savior. "
"5  i left you in crete so that you would correct the things that were defective* and make appointments of elders in city after city, as i instructed you:"
"6  if there is any man free from accusation, a husband of one wife, having believing children who are not accused of debauchery* or rebelliousness.+"
"7  for as god’s steward, an overseer must be free from accusation, not self-willed,+ not quick-tempered,+ not a drunkard, not violent,* not greedy of dishonest gain,"
"8  but hospitable,+ a lover of goodness, sound in mind,*+ righteous, loyal,+ self-controlled,+"
"9  holding firmly to the faithful word* as respects his art of teaching,+ so that he may be able both to encourage* by the teaching that is wholesome*+ and to reprove+ those who contradict. "
"10  for there are many rebellious men, profitless talkers, and deceivers, especially those who adhere to the circumcision.+"
"11  it is necessary to shut their mouths, because these very men keep on subverting entire households by teaching things they should not for the sake of dishonest gain."
"12  a certain one of them, their own prophet, said: “creʹtans are always liars, injurious wild beasts, idle gluttons.” "
"13  this witness is true. for this very reason, keep on reproving them with severity so that they may be healthy in the faith,"
14  paying no attention to jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
"15  all things are clean to clean people;+ but to those who are defiled and faithless, nothing is clean, for both their minds and their consciences are defiled.+"
"16  they publicly declare that they know god, but they disown him by their works,+ because they are detestable and disobedient and not approved for good work of any sort."
"2  you, however, keep on speaking what is consistent with wholesome* teaching.+"
"2  let the older men be moderate in habits, serious, sound in mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance."
"3  likewise, let the older women be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to a lot of wine, teachers of what is good,"
"4  so that they may advise* the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children,"
"5  to be sound in mind, chaste, working at home,* good, subjecting themselves to their own husbands,+ so that the word of god may not be spoken of abusively. "
"6  likewise, keep on urging the younger men to be sound in mind,+"
"7  showing yourself to be an example of fine works in every way. teach what is pure* with all seriousness,+"
"8  using wholesome* speech that cannot be criticized,+ so that those who oppose may be put to shame, having nothing negative* to say about us.+"
"9  let slaves be in subjection to their owners in all things,+ trying to please them, not talking back,"
"10  not stealing from them,+ but showing complete trustworthiness, so that in every way they may adorn the teaching of our savior, god.+ "
"11  for the undeserved kindness of god has been manifested, bringing salvation to all sorts of people.+"
"12  it trains us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires+ and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things,*+"
"13  while we wait for the happy hope+ and glorious manifestation of the great god and of our savior, jesus christ,"
"14  who gave himself for us+ to set us free*+ from every sort of lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people who are his own special possession, zealous for fine works.+ "
15  keep on speaking these things and exhorting* and reproving with full authority.+ do not let anyone look down on you.
"1  paul, a prisoner+ for the sake of christ jesus, and timothy+ our brother, to phi·leʹmon our beloved fellow worker,"
"2  and to apʹphi·a our sister, and to ar·chipʹpus+ our fellow soldier, and to the congregation that is in your house:+ "
3  may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ. 
"4  i always thank my god when i mention you in my prayers,+"
5  as i keep hearing of your faith and the love that you have for* the lord jesus and for* all the holy ones.
6  i pray that your sharing in the faith may move you to acknowledge every good thing that we have through christ.
"7  for i received much joy and comfort on hearing of your love, because the hearts* of the holy ones have been refreshed through you, brother. "
"8  for this very reason, though i have great freeness of speech in connection with christ to order you to do what is proper,"
"9  i would rather appeal to you on the basis of love, seeing that i am paul an older man, yes, now also a prisoner for the sake of christ jesus."
"10  i am appealing to you for my child, whose father i became+ while in prison,* o·nesʹi·mus.+"
"11  he was formerly useless to you, but now he is useful to you and to me."
"12  i am sending him back to you, yes him, my very own heart.* "
13  i would like to keep him here for myself so that he might take your place in ministering to me during my imprisonment for the sake of the good news.+
"14  but i do not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed may be done, not under compulsion, but of your own free will.+"
"15  perhaps this is really why he broke away for a short while,* so that you may have him back forever,"
"16  no longer as a slave,+ but as more than a slave, as a brother who is beloved,+ especially so to me, but how much more so to you, both in the flesh and in the lord."
"17  so if you consider me a friend,* receive him kindly the same way you would me."
"18  moreover, if he did you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to my account."
"19  i, paul, am writing with my own hand: i will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me even your own self."
"20  yes, brother, may i receive this assistance from you in connection with the lord; refresh my heart* in connection with christ. "
"21  i am confident that you will comply, so i am writing you, knowing that you will do even more than what i say."
"22  but along with that, also prepare a place for me to stay, for i am hoping that through your prayers i will be given back to you.*+ "
"23  sending you greetings is epʹa·phras,+ my fellow captive in union with christ jesus,"
"24  also mark, ar·is·tarʹchus,+ deʹmas,+ and luke,+ my fellow workers. "
25  the undeserved kindness of the lord jesus christ be with the spirit you show.
"3  consequently, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling,*+ consider the apostle and high priest whom we acknowledge*—jesus.+"
"2  he was faithful to the one who appointed him,+ just as moses also was in all the house of that one.+"
"3  for he* is counted worthy of more glory+ than moses, since the one who constructs a house has more honor than the house itself."
"4  of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is god."
"5  now moses was faithful as an attendant in all the house of that one as a testimony* of the things that were to be spoken afterward,"
"6  but christ was faithful as a son+ over god’s house. we are his house+ if, indeed, we hold on firmly to our freeness of speech and the hope of which we boast down to the end. "
"7  therefore, just as the holy spirit says,+ “today if you listen to his voice,"
"8  do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger, as in the day of testing in the wilderness,+"
"9  where your forefathers put me to the test and tried me, despite seeing my works for 40 years.+"
"10  this is why i became disgusted with this generation and said: ‘they always go astray in their hearts, and they have not come to know my ways.’"
11  so i swore in my anger: ‘they will not enter into my rest.’”+ 
"12  beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of you a wicked heart lacking faith by drawing away from the living god;+"
"13  but keep on encouraging one another each day, as long as it is called “today,”+ so that none of you should become hardened by the deceptive power of sin."
14  for we actually become partakers of* the christ only if we hold firmly down to the end the confidence we had at the beginning.+
"15  as it is said, “today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger.”+ "
"16  for who heard and yet provoked him to bitter anger? was it not, in fact, all those who went out of egypt under moses?+"
"17  moreover, with whom did god become disgusted for 40 years?+ was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?+"
18  and to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest? was it not to those who acted disobediently?
19  so we see that they could not enter in because of lack of faith.+
"7  for this mel·chizʹe·dek, king of saʹlem, priest of the most high god, met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,+"
"2  and abraham gave* him a tenth of everything. first, his name is translated “king of righteousness,” and then also king of saʹlem, that is, “king of peace.”"
"3  in being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life, but being made like the son of god, he remains a priest for all time.*+ "
"4  see how great this man was to whom abraham, the family head,* gave a tenth out of the best spoils.+"
"5  true, according to the law, those of the sons of leʹvi+ who receive their priestly office have a commandment to collect tithes from the people,+ that is, from their brothers, even though these are descendants* of abraham."
6  but this man who did not trace his genealogy from them took tithes from abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.+
7  now it is undeniable that the lesser one is blessed by the greater.
"8  and in the one case, it is men who are dying who receive tithes, but in the other case, it is someone of whom witness is given that he lives.+"
"9  and it could be said that even leʹvi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes through abraham,"
10  for he was still a future descendant* of his forefather when mel·chizʹe·dek met him.+ 
"11  if, then, perfection was attainable through the levitical priesthood+ (for it was a feature of the law that was given to the people), what further need would there be for another priest to arise who is said to be in the manner of mel·chizʹe·dek+ and not in the manner of aaron?"
"12  for since the priesthood is being changed, it becomes necessary to change the law as well.+"
"13  for the man about whom these things are said came from another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.+"
"14  for it is clear that our lord has descended from judah,+ yet moses said nothing about priests coming from that tribe. "
"15  and this becomes even clearer when another priest+ arises who is like mel·chizʹe·dek,+"
"16  who has become such, not by the legal requirement that depends on fleshly descent, but by the power of an indestructible life.+"
17  for it is said in witness of him: “you are a priest forever in the manner of mel·chizʹe·dek.”+ 
"18  so, then, the former commandment is set aside because it is weak and ineffective.+"
"19  for the law made nothing perfect,+ but the introduction of a better hope+ did, through which we are drawing near to god.+"
"20  also, inasmuch as this was not done without an oath being sworn"
"21  (for, indeed, there are men who have become priests without a sworn oath, but this one has become so through an oath sworn respecting him by the one who said: “jehovah* has sworn, and he will not change his mind,* ‘you are a priest forever’”),+"
22  jesus has accordingly become the guarantee* of a better covenant.+
"23  furthermore, many had to become priests in succession+ because death prevented them from continuing as such,"
"24  but because he continues alive forever,+ his priesthood has no successors."
"25  so he is able also to save completely those who are approaching god through him, because he is always alive to plead for them.+ "
"26  for it is fitting for us to have such a high priest who is loyal, innocent, undefiled,+ separated from the sinners, and exalted above the heavens.+"
"27  unlike those high priests, he does not need to offer up sacrifices daily,+ first for his own sins and then for those of the people,+ because he did this once for all time when he offered himself up.+"
"28  for the law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses,+ but the word of the oath+ sworn after the law appoints a son, who has been made perfect+ forever."
"12  so, then, because we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also throw off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us,+ and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,+"
"2  as we look intently at the chief agent and perfecter of our faith, jesus.+ for the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake,* despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of god.+"
"3  indeed, consider closely the one who has endured such hostile speech from sinners+ against their own interests, so that you may not get tired and give up.*+ "
"4  in your struggle against that sin, you have never yet resisted to the point of having your blood shed."
"5  and you have entirely forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons: “my son, do not belittle the discipline from jehovah,* nor give up when you are corrected by him;"
"6  for those whom jehovah* loves he disciplines, in fact, he scourges* everyone whom he receives as a son.”+ "
7  you need to endure as part of your discipline.* god is treating you as sons.+ for what son is not disciplined by his father?+
"8  but if you have not all shared in receiving this discipline, you are really illegitimate children, and not sons."
"9  furthermore, our human fathers* used to discipline us, and we gave them respect. should we not more readily submit ourselves to the father of our spiritual life and live?+"
"10  for they disciplined us for a short time according to what seemed good to them, but he does so for our benefit so that we may partake of his holiness.+"
"11  true, no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but it is painful;* yet afterward, it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. "
"12  therefore, strengthen the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,+"
"13  and keep making straight paths for your feet,+ so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but, rather, may be healed."
14  pursue peace with all people+ and the sanctification*+ without which no man will see the lord.
"15  carefully watch that no one fails to obtain the undeserved kindness of god, so that no poisonous root springs up to cause trouble and many are defiled by it;+"
"16  and watch that among you there is no one who is sexually immoral* nor anyone who does not appreciate sacred things, like eʹsau, who gave up his rights as firstborn in exchange for one meal.+"
"17  for you know that afterward when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for although he earnestly tried to bring about a change of mind* with tears,+ it was to no avail.* "
"18  for you have not approached something that can be felt+ and that has been set aflame with fire,+ and a dark cloud and thick darkness and a storm,+"
"19  and the blast of a trumpet+ and the voice speaking words,+ which on hearing, the people begged that nothing further should be spoken to them.+"
"20  for they could not bear the command: “if even a beast touches the mountain, it must be stoned.”+"
"21  also, the display was so terrifying that moses said: “i am afraid and trembling.”+"
"22  but you have approached a mount zion+ and a city of the living god, heavenly jerusalem,+ and myriads* of angels"
"23  in general assembly,+ and the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens, and god the judge of all,+ and the spiritual lives+ of righteous ones who have been made perfect,+"
"24  and jesus the mediator+ of a new covenant,+ and the sprinkled blood, which speaks in a better way than abel’s blood.+ "
"25  see that you do not refuse to listen to* the one who is speaking. for if those who refused to listen to the one giving divine warning on earth did not escape, how much more will we not escape if we turn away from him who speaks from the heavens!+"
"26  at that time his voice shook the earth,+ but now he has promised: “yet once more i will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.”+"
"27  now the expression “yet once more” indicates the removal of the things that are shaken, things that have been made, in order that the things not shaken may remain."
"28  therefore, seeing that we are to receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us continue to receive undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably offer god sacred service with godly fear and awe."
29  for our god is a consuming fire.+
1  long ago god spoke to our forefathers by means of the prophets on many occasions and in many ways.+
"2  now at the end of these days he has spoken to us by means of a son,+ whom he appointed heir of all things,+ and through whom he made the systems of things.*+"
"3  he is the reflection of god’s glory+ and the exact representation of his very being,+ and he sustains all things by the word of his power. and after he had made a purification for our sins,+ he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high.+"
4  so he has become better than the angels+ to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.+ 
"5  for example, to which one of the angels did god ever say: “you are my son; today i have become your father”?+ and again: “i will become his father, and he will become my son”?+"
"6  but when he again brings his firstborn+ into the inhabited earth, he says: “and let all of god’s angels do obeisance to him.”* "
"7  also, he says about the angels: “he makes his angels spirits, and his ministers*+ a flame of fire.”+"
"8  but about the son, he says: “god is your throne+ forever and ever, and the scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of uprightness.*"
"9  you loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. that is why god, your god, anointed you+ with the oil of exultation more than your companions.”+"
"10  and: “at the beginning, o lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands."
"11  they will perish, but you will remain; and just like a garment, they will all wear out,"
"12  and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, as a garment, and they will be changed. but you are the same, and your years will never come to an end.”+ "
13  but about which of the angels has he ever said: “sit at my right hand until i place your enemies as a stool for your feet”?+
"14  are they not all spirits for holy service,*+ sent out to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?"
"8  now this is the main point of what we are saying: we have such a high priest as this,+ and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens,+"
"2  a minister* of the holy place+ and of the true tent, which jehovah* set up, and not man."
3  for every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.+
"4  if he were on earth, he would not be a priest,+ since there are already men who offer the gifts according to the law."
"5  these men are offering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow+ of the heavenly things;+ just as moses, when about to construct the tent, was given the divine command: for he says: “see that you make all things after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.”+"
"6  but now jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry* because he is also the mediator+ of a correspondingly better covenant,+ which has been legally established on better promises.+ "
"7  if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second.+"
"8  for he does find fault with the people when he says: “‘look! the days are coming,’ says jehovah,* ‘when i will make with the house of israel and with the house of judah a new covenant."
"9  it will not be like the covenant that i made with their forefathers on the day i took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of egypt,+ because they did not remain in my covenant, so i stopped caring for them,’ says jehovah.* "
"10  “‘for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days,’ says jehovah.* ‘i will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts i will write them.+ and i will become their god, and they will become my people.+ "
"11  “‘and they will no longer teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying: “know jehovah!”* for they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them."
"12  for i will be merciful toward their unrighteous deeds, and i will no longer call their sins to mind.’”+ "
"13  in his saying “a new covenant,” he has made the former one obsolete.+ now what is obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away.+"
"11  faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for,+ the evident demonstration* of realities that are not seen."
"2  for by means of it, the men of ancient times* had witness borne to them. "
"3  by faith we perceive that the systems of things* were put in order by god’s word, so that what is seen has come into existence from things that are not visible. "
"4  by faith abel offered god a sacrifice of greater worth than that of cain,+ and through that faith he received the witness that he was righteous, for god approved* his gifts,+ and although he died, he still speaks+ through his faith. "
"5  by faith eʹnoch+ was transferred so as not to see death, and he was nowhere to be found because god had transferred him;+ for before he was transferred he received the witness that he had pleased god well."
"6  moreover, without faith it is impossible to please god well, for whoever approaches god must believe that he is* and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.+ "
"7  by faith noah,+ after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen,+ showed godly fear and constructed an ark+ for the saving of his household; and through this faith he condemned the world,+ and he became an heir of the righteousness that results from faith. "
"8  by faith abraham,+ when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place he was to receive as an inheritance; he went out, although not knowing where he was going.+"
"9  by faith he lived as a foreigner in the land of the promise as in a foreign land,+ living in tents+ with isaac and jacob, the heirs with him of the very same promise.+"
"10  for he was awaiting the city having real foundations, whose designer* and builder is god.+ "
"11  by faith also sarah received power to conceive offspring,* even when she was past the age,+ since she considered him faithful* who made the promise."
"12  for this reason, from one man who was as good as dead,+ there were born children,+ as many as the stars of heaven in number and as innumerable as the sands by the seaside.+ "
"13  in faith all of these died, although they did not receive the fulfillment of the promises;+ but they saw them from a distance+ and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land."
14  for those who speak in such a way make it evident that they are earnestly seeking a place of their own.
"15  and yet, if they had kept remembering the place from which they had departed,+ they would have had opportunity to return."
"16  but now they are reaching out for a better place, that is, one belonging to heaven. therefore, god is not ashamed of them, to be called on as their god,+ for he has prepared a city for them.+ "
"17  by faith abraham, when he was tested,+ as good as offered up isaac—the man who had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up his only-begotten son+—"
18  although it had been said to him: “what will be called your offspring* will be through isaac.”+
"19  but he reasoned that god was able to raise him up even from the dead, and he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.+ "
20  by faith also isaac blessed jacob+ and eʹsau+ concerning things to come. 
"21  by faith jacob, when about to die,+ blessed each of the sons of joseph+ and worshipped while leaning on the top of his staff.+ "
"22  by faith joseph, nearing his end, spoke of the exodus of the sons of israel, and he gave instructions* concerning his bones.*+ "
"23  by faith moses was hid by his parents for three months after his birth,+ because they saw that the young child was beautiful+ and they did not fear the order of the king.+"
"24  by faith moses, when grown up,+ refused to be called the son of pharʹaoh’s daughter,+"
"25  choosing to be mistreated with the people of god rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin,"
"26  because he considered the reproach of the christ to be riches greater than the treasures of egypt, for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward."
"27  by faith he left egypt,+ but not fearing the anger of the king,+ for he continued steadfast as seeing the one who is invisible.+"
"28  by faith he observed the passover and the splashing of the blood, so that the destroyer might not harm* their firstborn.+ "
"29  by faith they passed through the red sea as on dry land,+ but when the egyptians attempted it, they were swallowed up.+ "
30  by faith the walls of jerʹi·cho fell down after the people had marched around them for seven days.+
"31  by faith raʹhab the prostitute did not perish with those who acted disobediently, because she received the spies in a peaceable way.+ "
"32  and what more will i say? for time will fail me if i go on to relate about gidʹe·on,+ baʹrak,+ samson,+ jephʹthah,+ david,+ as well as samuel+ and the other prophets."
"33  through faith they defeated kingdoms,+ brought about righteousness, obtained promises,+ stopped the mouths of lions,+"
"34  quenched the force of fire,+ escaped the edge of the sword,+ from a weak state were made powerful,+ became mighty in war,+ routed invading armies.+"
"35  women received their dead by resurrection,+ but other men were tortured because they would not accept release by some ransom, in order that they might attain a better resurrection."
