"4 of cour@@ se, every house is con@@ stru@@ cted by some@@ one, but the one who con@@ stru@@ cted all things is god@@ ."
"5 now moses was faith@@ ful as an atten@@ d@@ ant in all the house of that one as a tes@@ ti@@ mon@@ y* of the things that were to be spoken af@@ ter@@ war@@ d@@ ,"

"15 as it is said, “@@ today if you listen to his voi@@ ce, do not har@@ d@@ en your hear@@ ts as on the o@@ c@@ ca@@ sion of pro@@ vo@@ king to bit@@ ter ang@@ er@@ .”+ "

"17 more@@ over, with whom did god become dis@@ gu@@ sted for 40 year@@ s@@ ?+ was it not with those who sin@@ n@@ ed, whose dead bo@@ di@@ es fell in the wilder@@ ness@@ ?+"
18 and to whom did he s@@ w@@ ear that they would not enter into his re@@ st@@ ? was it not to those who ac@@ ted dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent@@ ly@@ ?
19 so we see that they could not enter in because of la@@ ck of faith@@ .+

"28 therefore, see@@ ing that we are to recei@@ ve a kingdom that cannot be sha@@ ken@@ , let us continue to recei@@ ve un@@ deser@@ ved kind@@ ness, through which we may ac@@ cep@@ tab@@ ly offer god sa@@ c@@ red serv@@ ice with god@@ ly fear and a@@ we@@ ."
29 for our god is a consu@@ m@@ ing fire@@ .+
1 long a@@ go god spoke to our forefathers by means of the prophets on many o@@ c@@ ca@@ sion@@ s and in many way@@ s.+

"2 a mini@@ ster@@ * of the holy place@@ + and of the true ten@@ t, which jehovah@@ * set up, and not man@@ ."
3 for every high priest is appointed to offer both gi@@ f@@ ts and sacrifi@@ ces@@ ; so it was ne@@ ces@@ s@@ ary for this one also to have something to offer@@ .+
"4 if he were on ear@@ th, he would not be a pries@@ t@@ ,+ since there are al@@ ready men who offer the gi@@ f@@ ts according to the law@@ ."
